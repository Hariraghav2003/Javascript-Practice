    <h1>Objects!!</h1>
    <p>
        An object is like a reak time which has several properties,Ex:Car it's a object which has several properties such as break accel clutch headlight color etc..
        <br>
        <code>
            const car={type:"maruti",model:"suzuki",color:"grey"} <br>
        </code>
        this is the sample code where car is the object which has 3 properties such as type,model,color and each has values maruti,suzuki,grey.
    </p>

    <h4>Javascript object properties</h4>
    <p>
        The Javascript object properties can be accessed or modified in below ways,
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Accessing properties of  object:</b> The properties of the object can be accessed in 3 ways
                but the most common is using dot(.) operator <br>
                <code>
                    const car={type:"maruti",model:"suzuki",color:"grey"} <br>
                    console.log(car.color); <br>
                </code>
                The <mark> car.color</mark> access the car object's color property using dot operator and prints the value using console.log
            </li>
            <li>
                <b> Adding new properties: </b> to add new properties we code like this <br>
                <code>
                    car.cc="1220cc" <br>
                </code>
                where cc is a new property of car which is added to car like <mark> car.cc="1220"</mark> 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b> Deleting properties:</b> to delete new properties we code like this <br>
                <code>
                    delete car.cc; <br>                   
                </code>
                here the newly added cc property is deleted using delete keyword
            </li>
        </ol> 
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h4>Javascript object methods</h4>
    <p>
        The Javascript object methods are declaring function as an object property like this <br>
        <code>
            car.carname= function(){ <br>
                return this.type+""+this.model; <br>
            }; <br>
            console.log(car.carname()); <br>
        </code>
        here car name is an object method because it's declared as a function.Like this we can declare by adding or we can declare when we define the object.
        Important note: we must use this keyword while handling objects inside a function.
    </p>
    <h4>Javascript object display</h4>
    <p>
        The Javascript objects can be displayed in 4 ways
        <ol>
            <li>Object values:It display the values of object</li>
            <li>Object enteries:It display the object with their property and values</li>
            <li>Stringyyfy:displays object in JSON format</li>
            <li>loop:used to diplay the object which has more properties using for loop</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h4>Javascript object constructor</h4>
    <p>Creating a object using this and new keyword</p>
    <script>
        const car={type:"maruti",model:"suzuki",color:"grey"}
        console.log(car.color);
        car.cc="1220cc"
        console.log(car.cc);
        delete car.cc;
        console.log(car.cc);
        car.carname= function(){
            return this.type+""+this.model;
        };
        console.log(car.carname());
    </script>
